      <h1>The Nike SB Dunk</h1>
      <p>Designed by Peter Moore, the Nike Dunk initially released in 1985. The Dunk was intended to give Nike footing in the college basketball scene, with colors to match the jerseys of college teams. The Nike Dunk has since recieved much aclaim for its skate version that helped kickstart Nike Skateboarding.</p>
      <p>Despite a couple of failed attempts to break into the skateboarding market, Nike turned to employee Sandy Bodecker to finally get the ball rolling. Bodecker noted that Nike didn't have the respect of the skate community, but skaters have been using certain Nike basketball sneakers to skate in for years. The Nike Blazers, Dunks, and Jordan 1s were some of the most skated in Nikes prior to thheir Skateboarding line. Bodecker then signed four pro skaters and gave the dunk a design upgrade. A puffy nylon tounge was added to the shoe as well as a better sole for skating. Bodecker and skater Reese Forbes then drove around America pitching their shoes to independant skate shops. Once they established a big enough stocklist they released the first four colorways of the Nike Dunk SBs. These four models were for the four skaters signed to Nike SB at the time.</p>
      <p>The Nike SB line has fluctuated in popularity over time. Collecters often refer back to different epochs in the SB timeline by the color of their boxes. While their earliest boxes were orange and natural, this was only for 2002. The Silver Box era lasted from January 2003 - September 2004. Next was the pink box which lasted through 2005. Followed by the Black box era which spanned most of 2006 and 2007. From October 2007 - March 2009 reigned the gold box. The shoes were all downhill from there, but man did they release some beutiful shoes with materials that pushed the envelope.</p>
